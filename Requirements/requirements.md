## 📂 Case File: The Quick Commerce Conundrum
**Target:** QuickBazaar (Pune-based Startup)  
**Current Status:** Critical / Brink of Failure  
**Objective:** Execute a data-driven turnaround strategy to reverse negative trends.

### 📉 The Problem Landscape
As the lead Data Analyst, this project addresses three severe operational anomalies:
*   **Revenue Bleed:** Average Order Value (AOV) has dropped by **30%**.
*   **Customer Retention:** Significant spike in Customer Churn rates.
*   **Logistics Failure:** Increased frequency of late deliveries.

## 🛠️ The Arsenal (Tech Stack & Tools)
To diagnose the root cause and formulate a recovery plan, this project utilizes the following data intelligence suite:

### 1. Data Foundation & Statistical Power
*   **Google Sheets:** Utilized for initial data cleaning, sorting, and pivot table analysis to organize raw delivery logs.
*   **Binder (Jupyter Notebooks):** Used for high-level statistical analysis, calculating correlations, and validating hypothesis testing.

### 2. Visual Intelligence (No-Code/Low-Code)
*   **Orange Data Mining:** Deployed for rapid Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), generating heatmaps and distribution arrays to spot patterns without extensive coding.
*   **Flourish:** Leveraged for advanced storytelling, creating interactive charts and geospatial maps to visualize delivery routes and delay hotspots.

### 3. AI-Powered Insight Generation
*   **Large Language Models (ChatGPT/Gemini):**
    *   *Task:* Sentiment Analysis on unstructured customer feedback.
    *   *Prompt Engineering:* Extracting top complaints (e.g., "Rude Rider," "Missing Items") to humanize the data trends.
*   **Perplexity AI / Napkin.ai:** Used for supplemental research and rapid visualization of strategic concepts.
