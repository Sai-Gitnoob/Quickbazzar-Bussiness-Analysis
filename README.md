# Quickbazzar-Bussiness-Analysis
Business-focused data science project on an imaginative e-commerce company, QuickBazaar. Performed explanatory analysis inspired by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic to identify churn drivers like bad packaging, delays, stockouts, and support issues, and proposed data-driven operational and tech solutions.

# 📦 QuickBazaar: Customer Churn Reduction through Storytelling with Data

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository presents an **industry-grade data science and business analytics project** built around *QuickBazaar*, an **imaginative e-commerce company**.
The goal of the project was to **diagnose rising customer churn and propose actionable, data-driven solutions** using principles from **Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic’s *Storytelling with Data***.

Rather than focusing on complex models first, this project emphasizes **clarity, business relevance, and decision-oriented insights**, aligning with **IIT-level academic rigor** and **industry expectations**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

QuickBazaar was experiencing:

* Declining repeat customers
* Increasing complaints despite stable order volumes
* Silent churn that traditional dashboards failed to highlight

The central challenge was:

> **Why are customers leaving, and what must the business change immediately?**

---

## 🧠 Analytical Philosophy & Approach

This project follows an **explanatory data analysis (EDA → Insight → Action)** framework.

Inspired by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic:

* Removed unnecessary visual clutter
* Highlighted comparisons that matter to decision-makers
* Designed visuals to answer *“So what?”* instead of *“What happened?”*

**Focus:**
✔ Business questions
✔ Executive storytelling
✔ Actionable recommendations

## 🏢 About the Company (Case Context)

**QuickBazaar** is a fictional mid-scale e-commerce platform operating in fast-moving consumer goods and daily essentials.

Its competitive advantage relied on:

* Fast delivery
* Affordable pricing
* High order volume

However, operational inefficiencies were eroding customer trust.

---

## ⚠️ Key Business Problems Identified

Through structured analysis and visualization, the following **primary churn drivers** were identified:

1. **Rising customer churn due to poor packaging quality**
2. **Higher delivery times compared to competitors**
3. **Product damage caused by inadequate packaging standards**
4. **Inefficient and slow customer support**
5. **Frequent out-of-stock incidents**
6. **Lack of operational visibility across teams**

Individually minor, collectively catastrophic.

---

## 📊 Insights from Explanatory Analysis

* Customers receiving damaged products showed **significantly lower retention**
* Delivery delays had a **direct correlation with negative reviews**
* Stockouts increased cart abandonment and reduced trust
* Support inefficiency amplified dissatisfaction instead of resolving it

📌 **Core Insight:**
QuickBazaar was not losing customers due to pricing or product range, but due to **operational execution failures**.

## 🚀 Data-Driven Solutions Proposed

The solutions were designed to **align technology, incentives, and people**.

### 1️⃣ Unified Operations App

A single integrated platform to manage:

* Warehouse operations
* Rider performance tracking
* Inventory levels
* Customer satisfaction feedback

This eliminated data silos and enabled real-time monitoring.

---

### 2️⃣ Rider Reward & Penalty Framework

* Timely, careful deliveries → **Performance-based rewards**
* Repeated delays or mishandling → **Penalties and retraining**

This introduced accountability and improved delivery discipline.

---

### 3️⃣ Smarter Route Planning Algorithms

* Optimized rider routes
* Reduced delivery times
* Lowered operational costs

Result: faster deliveries with the same workforce.

---

### 4️⃣ Skilled Hiring & Workforce Upskilling

* Trained warehouse staff improved packaging quality
* Skilled support executives reduced resolution time

Human capital was treated as a **core system component**, not a cost.

---

### 5️⃣ Inventory Intelligence & Forecasting

* Demand-based stock replenishment
* Low-stock alerts
* Reduced out-of-stock incidents

Customers stopped encountering “Unavailable” during checkout.
